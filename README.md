# Image Slider

## Description
This Image Slider project allows users to view images in a slideshow format. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The slider automatically cycles through images, and users can also manually navigate through them using navigation buttons.

## Features
- Automatic and manual image transitions.
- Responsive design that adjusts to screen size.
- Use of modern JavaScript features for interactivity.

## Installation

To install this image slider, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a modern web browser installed to run the project (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

## Usage

To use the image slider, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The slider should start automatically. You can use the navigation buttons on either side of the images to move through the images manually.

### Files included:
- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the image slider.
- `style.css`: Styles the image slider, including the layout and animation effects.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript needed for the dynamic behavior of the slider.

## How it Works

### HTML
The HTML file sets up the image slider's structure, including a container for images and navigation buttons.

### CSS
The CSS file styles the slider and includes animations for transitioning between images. It ensures the images and navigation buttons are appropriately positioned and styled.

### JavaScript
The JavaScript file contains the logic for the image slider. It handles user interactions with the navigation buttons and automates the image transition every three seconds. The script adjusts the image container's transform property to slide between images.
